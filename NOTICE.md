## Fonts

Newsreader and IBM Plex Sans are bundled under the SIL Open Font License 1.1; see
`frontend/src/assets/fonts/OFL-*.txt`. The woff2 files come from the npm packages
`@fontsource-variable/newsreader` 5.3.0 (Newsreader, optical-size variable files, latin and
latin-ext) and `@fontsource/ibm-plex-sans` 5.3.0 (IBM Plex Sans 400, 500 and 600, latin and
latin-ext), fetched with `npm pack`. The packages are not dependencies, and nothing is fetched
at runtime.
