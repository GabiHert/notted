#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Builds and publishes a release from this Mac. No CI is involved. Settings come from release.conf.
# Usage: make release              next patch version after the newest tag (v0.2.1 → v0.2.2)
#        make release V=v0.3.0     a version you choose
#
# Steps, stopping at the first failure:
#   1. Checks: on $BRANCH, nothing uncommitted, not behind origin, the tag and release are new,
#      gh is signed in as $GH_ACCOUNT.
#   2. Changelog: CHANGELOG.md must have entries under [Unreleased] (or a section for the version).
#      The release is refused without them.
#   3. Tests: $TEST_CMD.
#   4. Changelog promoted: [Unreleased] moves under "## [X.Y.Z] - date", so the build embeds it.
#   5. Build: scripts/build-release.sh (zip + SHA256SUMS; signing from the environment).
#   6. Commit the changelog, tag, push the branch and the tag, then create the GitHub Release with
#      both files, using the changelog section as the release notes.
# A failure before step 6 leaves no tag, push or release behind, and CHANGELOG.md is put back.
# From the release-updater skill (~/.claude/skills/release-updater).
